I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science, [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn).

I am mostly interested in applied Deep Learning for Generative Model. My current research topics are about saliency including saliency detection, saliency retarget and so on. I am fortunate to work with [Shengfeng He](http://www.shengfenghe.com/).
